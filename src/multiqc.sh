# Basic execution pattern: Your app will run on a single machine from
# beginning to end.
#
# Your job's input variables (if any) will be loaded as environment
# variables before this script runs.  Any array inputs will be loaded
# as bash arrays.
#
# Any code outside of main() (or any entry point you may add) is
# ALWAYS executed, followed by running the entry point itself.

# Exit at any point if there is any error and output each line as it is executed (for debugging)
